Code execution steps for each algorithm implemented 

Mahout Recommendation :
1.Inside the package of the recommendation , execute the mahout.sh shell script on the hadoop folder 
2.Place the 2 mahout jars and the mahout recommendation jar inside the hadoop folder 
3 run the shell scipts and the output will be generated in the hdfs .
4 total of 6 map reduce jobs running with the mahout recommendation engine .


Sentimental Analysis :
1.Place the jar inside the mahout library along with all the jars of the the NLP core .
2.Execute the jar which require parameters as : hadoop jar sentimental_both.jar Runner_Stanfard /review /output1 /output2 /sentimental_top3
Here  we have review as the datasource and output1 , output2 as the intermedidate outputs then the sentimental_top3 as the final output .
3. The job partitions the data on the base of the length of the review and executes the jobs in parallel .

Market Basket :
1. Place the market basket jar inside the hadoop folder and execute the following command :
hadoop jar market_basket.jar Cloud.ApacheLog.Runner /MarketData /output1 /output2 /market_Output
Here 3 jobs are running with intermedidate output as output1 , output2 and the final result is in market_output and MarketData is the hdfs input file path .

RScripts :
1.There are 2 projects inside the scipts , one on user/item recommendation and the other on the market basket analysis .
2.Place the input file and launch the project on the R studio with the input files in the directory .

Logistic Regression :
1.Place the mahout jar in the hadoop folder and execute the mahout logistic command on the terminal as :
training command : bin/mahout org.apache.mahout.classifier.sgd.TrainLogistic --passes 10 --rate 50 --lambda 0.1 --input /Users/ruchirapatil/Downloads/queryresult9.csv --features 21 --output /Users/ruchirapatil/Downloads/queryresult9.model --target overallrating --categories 2 --predictors price categorynumber salesrank --types n n
Testing command : bin/mahout org.apache.mahout.classifier.sgd.RunLogistic --input /Users/ruchirapatil/Downloads/combovideogamescellphone.csv --model /Users/ruchirapatil/Downloads/combovideogamescellphone.model --auc --scores --confusion

Hue/Hive Scipts:
1. Load the data into the tables of the Amazon hue clustor 
2. Run the commands on the editor .
